EXAM 1

1.a)Recreate the plot below using input data from the file :
b) Describe the plot
c) Choose a suitable statistical test and use that to determine whether there is a significant difference in
the mean number of people sharing the award for Chemistry and the mean number of people sharing
the award for Peace (for all available years).

2. SDU Admissions in 2019
a) Show 5 most popular educations at SDU (Popularity = number of applicants/number of places).
Expected formatting below.

b) A 100 random admitted students were chosen for a survey to find out why they came to study at SDU.
Chosen group included 72 students from Bachelors education, 10 from Engineering and 18 from Diploma
Engineering. Conduct a 2-test to check wheter it is a suitable representation of new students body
(Start with calculation of proportions of places available for students within Bachelors, Engineering
and Diploma Engineering educations).

3. New Zealand Kiwi
The data in the files data/kiwi_codes.csv and data/kiwi.csv is the basis for this exercise.
a) Add species name to the kiwi dataset using data from kiwi_codes.csv. For each species, calculate mean
female/male weight and height. Present results in the below shown formatting.
b) Create box plot of Kiwi weight distribution, divided according to species and gender. Describe the
plot.
c) Make a linear fit to the weight of Great Spotted Kiwi in relation to it’s height.
d) Check the assumptions for making linear fit from c). Is there anything you would do different?

3. Gummy bears
A sample of 1.5 kg gummy bears consisting of 669 whole gummy bears was taken from a production line.
Within that sample, there were 12.4% of strawberry gummy bears, 21.2% raspberry, 14.9% lemon, 15.4%
orange, 15.5% apple and 20.5% pineapple gummy bears. Conduct a 2-test to check whether it is reasonable,
based on this sample, to assume equal proportions of the different kinds of gummy bears are being produced.

4.of 2002. Ryanair wants to break into the U.S. market with a new route in between Casper, Nebraska (-) and
San Francisco, California (SFO). Currently there are no commercial flights from Casper, and due to that
the city is not included in the database.
The distance in between two cities is 1200 miles and is expected to have approximately 100 passengers per
week.
a) Create a linear model to predict ‘Average Fare’ using ‘Distance’. Evaluate the model and propose a
price for a ticket in between Casper and San Francisco.
b) List all variables present in the data set. For each of them mark if you find them suitable as input
for multiple regression model and explain why. Also, since the price of the ticket might be strongly
dependend on origin/destination airport, would you limit the data to some entries prior to modeling
and why?
c) Create two multiple regression models to predict Average Fare using:
• Distance, Average Weekly Passengers, Market Share MLA,
• Distance, Market Share MLA
Which one is better in your opinion and why? Use chosen model to predict an average fare for new route in
between Casper and San Francisco.

2.The seatbelt legislation was introduced on 31 January 1983 in the UK. The data was collected for patients
admitted to ER department of the District General Hospital in Merton and Sutton for the year proceeding
and succeeding legislation. Random 20% of cases from all collected were used for the experiment:
• 95 cases for the period 1st of February 1982 - 31st of January 1983
• 85 cases for the period of 1st of February 1983 - 31st of January 1984.
The injuries were assessed on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (1-6) and then classified into Injury Severity
Score - ISS with three levels: ‘No injury’, ‘Mild’ and ‘Moderate’.
ISS 1982/83 1983/84
No injury 31 44
Mild 53 35
Moderate 11 6
Do the mandatory seatbelts appear to make a diference? Check whether there is a significant correlation in
between severity of the injuries and time period the accident occurred.

3. Life expectancy through the years
What is Life Expectancy around the world like? There are two data sets provided:
• data/life_expectancy.csv contains information from years 2000-2015 about different countries in the
world
• data/country_continent.csv contains information about countries and continents they belong to.

a) Join those two datasets.
b) Show the country with the highest life expectancy per continent in the year 2008. Present the results
in descending order in a table formatted like example below:
The example table presents lowest Life Expectancy countries per continent in 2004.
Continent Country Life Expectancy
Europe Russia 64.9
Oceania Papua New Guinea 59.9
Americas Haiti 58.7
Asia Afghanistan 57.0
Africa Sierra Leone 42.3
c) Limit the data to year 2010. Which out of following variables are staistically significant in modeling of
Life Expectancy? Status, Income_composition_of_resources, Alcohol, Percentage_Expenditure, BMI,
HIV, GDP, Schooling Create a multiple regression model.
d) Are the conditions for a valid linear fit fulfilled in this case?

2. Gender and exam performance.
The dataset biology.csv contains personal information about students with a ‘Biology’ major.
a) Join to biology.csv a dataset from the previous exercise - data/students_exam_performance.csv.
b) Present mean Statistics exam score divided acording to gender in formating shown below:
gender Mean Mathematics Exam score
Female 76.94465
Male 77.27941
c) Is there a significant correlation between Biology students’ gender and the Math exam grade they’ve
received? Conduct a 2 − test for independence to check this hypothesis.

3. Cars
Imagine you live in 1985 in U.S.A. It’s time to buy your first car. You got your choices down to two models:
Parameter Car no. 1 Car no. 2
Horsepower 110 140
Displacement 220 280
Cylinders 6 8
year 1977 1973
Weight 3800 3700
0-60 mph in seconds 16 12
Origin America Asia
Now it’s time to make a decision. You have a dataset data/cars_70s.csv containing multiple cars sold in the
US.
a) Use this data set to create and tune a model to predict miles per gallon (MPG). Start with variables:
Year, Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Seconds0to60, Origin.
b) Are the conditions for a valid linear fit fulfilled in this case?
c) Predict MPG value for both cars. The one with higher MPG value is the one to buy. Which one is it?
